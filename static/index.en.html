                            "Dr. Sergio Alberto Aguilar Rodríguez is a renowned lawyer in the Department of Antioquia (Colombia), whom I know from university classrooms. Later I had the pleasure of sharing with many years with him in the General Attorney's Office, where he
                            performed amazingly in front of the superior courts of Antioquia and Medellin. His excellent academic qualities, his good judgment and legal criterion, and his commitment to legal work, are accompanied by his sense of justice and his quality of a man
                            who acts with decorum within the profession of law and with absolute respect concerning those who have been his companions. His name is synonymus with equanimity and a humanitarian sense for the causes of permanent debate in the administration of
                            justice."
